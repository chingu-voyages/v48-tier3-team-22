# Dinosaurs 	🦖






## 🌍 Overview

This app was developed as a part of the 6-week [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 48 in March and April 202. The app uses data from [Dinosaurs API](https://chinguapi.onrender.com/dinosaurs)and [News API](https://chinguapi.onrender.com/dinosaurs).

The goals for this project included:

- To create a purely fullstack application using the provided data.
- To use any language, tool, or library to plan, design, and build the app.
- To build the app without the use of AI-base solution generators like GitHub CoPilot.
- Implement key features, including:
  -  A search functionality enabling users to find dinosaurs by name.
  - A page that display dinosaurs' names and corresponding images sourced from the provided JSON file. Each dinosaur entry should be clickable to view full details.

  - A Dinosaurs News Page showcasing the latest news where dinosaurs are mentioned, ensuring correctness of displayed content.

  In addition to the goals related to the application functionality, our team also had goals related to building experience working with an international, remote team of developers:
  - To try using new tools to build the application.
  - To manage workflow with an international, remote team of developers and product owner.
